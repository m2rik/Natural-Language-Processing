    "# In the spam detection problem, there are 2 classes: C1 which is the no-spam (ham) class and C2 which is the spam class. X is essentially each email present in the training data. To convert X into a machine-readable form (number), we basically need to convert X into a vector. We achieve it by the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an ordered list of all the words in the vocabulary. For instance, suppose we have the following words in the vocabulary: [lottery, how, won, offer, thanks, the, you].\n",
    "# To convert an email into a vector, map out the number of times each word occurs in that email. For instance, consider the following email: you won the lottery. The vector form of the above email would be [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1].\n",
    "# Now that we have mapped each email into a vector, we can apply the Naive Bayes algorithm on the data. Observe that in the above process, we assumed that each word is produced independent of each other and we discarded the ordering of words in the email. This exactly is the “Naive” assumption and that’s how we plan to apply the Naive Bayes algorithm to this problem."
